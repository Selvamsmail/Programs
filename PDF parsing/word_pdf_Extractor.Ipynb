      "10. ------    The size of oceanic waves is a function of the velocity of the wind and of   fetch,   the length of the surface of the water subject to those winds. The impact of waves against a coastline is a function of the size of the waves and the shape of the sea bottom. The degree of erosion to which a coastline is subject is a function of the average impact of waves and the geologic composition of the coastline. If these statements are true, which one of the following must also be true?\n",
      "11. ------    Health insurers are largely immune to the factors that are limiting profit in many sec - tors of the healthcare economy. Consumers have shown a willingness to pay almost any price for health insurance premiums. Capital demands, which are the responsibility of doc- tors and hospitals, are increasing dramatically, even as cost-containment measures, largely encouraged by the insurers and their friends in government, have forced new levels of fiscal discipline upon hospitals and doctors. Patients still need MRIs and buildings to put them in, but hospitals are limited in how much they can charge patients for the use of these facilities.

      "13. ------    Forcing businesses to furnish employees with paid leave for family concerns, such as paternity leave or leave to care for a sick child, is a terrible idea. If a business allows employ- ees to take this time off, the workers will take advantage of the privilege and come to work as little as possible. This will destroy productivity and workplace morale. Which one of the following, if true, most seri- ously weakens the argument?\n",
      "14. ------    Not all of the players was on board with the new uniforms for the girls’ basketball team, but the team made their choices.\n",
      "15. ------    The nation’s increasing reliance on automa- tion is reducing the number of jobs available to hardworking people, forcing many families to make the unfortunate choice between having a roof over their heads or receiving healthcare.\n",
      "16. ------    Software engineers know that a poorly written application can consume more memory than it should and that running out of memory can cause an application to crash. However, if a crashing application causes the whole oper- ating system to crash, the fault lies with the operating system. Which one of the following, if true, is least helpful in establishing that this conclusion is properly drawn?\n",
      "17. ------    This museum does not grant people the right to use images of items in its collection in online publications. We are obliged to do everything in our power to ensure the contin- ued appeal of visiting our collection in person. The conclusion above depends on assuming which one of the following?\n",
      "18. ------    The town’s legislators heard arguments from the crowd about how town facilities and parks no longer properly accommodate the towns- people now that the number of residents have increased so considerably.\n",
      "19. ------    Risks are effected by human actions that increase or decrease vulnerability, like where people live and how they build.\n",

      "24. ------    Career counselor: Many large international companies have changed their practices regarding international assignments. They are placing much more emphasis on help- ing spouses of expatriate employees to adjust to the foreign environment. This has reduced premature returns by 67 percent. Which one of the following is an assumption upon which the career counselor’s argument depends?\n",
      "25. ------    One work of art is not more important because it was made after another nor does it make its predecessor obsolete.\n",
      "26. ------    A most unsociable dog he proved to be, resent- ing all their advances, refusing to let them lay hands on him, menacing them with bared fangs and bristling hair.\n",
      "27. ------    Scientists have discovered a gene that controls whether an individual is monogamous. They took a gene from the monogamous prairie vole and implanted it into its more promiscuous rel- ative, the meadow vole. Thereafter, the meadow voles with the new gene became monogamous. Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the argument’s conclusion?\n",
      "28. ------    Physician: Scottish researchers have developed a test that allows them to predict at what age a woman will experience menopause. The sci- entists use a model that compares a woman’s ovaries to “average” ovaries to see whether her ovaries are aging faster or more slowly than average. They have discovered that the size of ovaries is directly related to the number of eggs they contain, which in turn is directly related to fertility. This discovery will signifi - cantly influence women’s decisions on when to have children. The physician’s conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? starts to decline at the age of 37.\n",
      "29. ------    The top two students, Arthur and Abraham, excelled not only academically but in athletics too.\n",
      "30. ------    To earn a graduate equivalency diploma, a student must pass tests on subjects taught in high schools, proving that he or she has mastered them to the degree assumed of a high-school graduate. It makes sense for a student to drop out of high school and earn a GED. A GED takes much less time to earn than a high-school diploma and provides evidence that the student has learned everything he or she would have learned in high school. Which one of the following, if true, most seri- ously weakens the argument?\n",
      "31. ------    The primary purpose of this passage is to\n",
      "32. ------    According to the passage, all of the following decrease the economic benefits of technologi - cal investment EXCEPT:\n",
      "33. ------    When the author asserts that companies take a “siloed and reactive” approach to cybersecu- rity, he is implying that companies\n",
      "34. ------    Which of the following is most likely an example of intellectual property as mentioned in the second paragraph?\n",
      "35. ------    It can be inferred from the passage that the author considers which of the following to be true regarding increased global connectivity?\n",
      "36. ------    I bought a pair of glasses from an optometrist. One of the lenses regularly pops out of the frame. Therefore, this optometrist doesn’t know how to make a good pair of glasses. The reasoning in the argument is most vul- nerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument\n",
      "37. ------    A new kind of primate, the fat-tailed lemur, has been discovered in Madagascar. These lemurs hibernate, sleeping in holes in trees for up to seven months out of the year. Winter temperatures in Madagascar rarely drop below 86 degrees, so these lemurs do not hibernate to escape the cold but perhaps to conserve energy during the dry season, when food is scarce. This is the first time anyone has found an animal that hibernates during hot weather, disproving the common belief that only ani- mals in cold climates hibernate. Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the assertion that this is the first time anyone has found an animal that hibernates during hot weather?\n",
      "38. ------    When we think about peoples of the past, we intuitively try to imagine what he or she would have looked like in real life and to visual- ize their physical features, dress, and general appearance.\n",
      "39. ------    Motorcyclists are told to always wear helmets when they ride their motorcycles. But helmets only protect riders when they have wrecks, and wrecks occur only once out of every 1,000 rides. Therefore, a motorcyclist would be per- fectly safe if he wore his helmet only once out of every 1,000 rides. Which one of the following employs a flawed argumentative strategy that is most closely parallel to the flawed argumentative strategy in this statement?\n",
      "40. ------    Even though Carter had fewer quarters in his piggybank than did his brother Clark, Clark had less money overall.\n",
      "41. ------    Rugby is somewhat like American football in that both involve downs, tackles, and touch- downs, but it also combines elements from other sports, like soccer and hurling.\n"
